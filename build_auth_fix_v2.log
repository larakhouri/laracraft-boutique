> Build error occurred
Error: Turbopack build failed with 1 errors:
./middleware.ts
Middleware is missing expected function export name
This function is what Next.js runs for every request handled by this middleware.

Why this happens:
- The file exists but doesn't export a function.
- The export is not a function (e.g., an object or constant).
- There's a syntax error preventing the export from being recognized.

To fix it:
- Ensure this file has either a default or "middleware" function export.
